## Hello everyone üëã

My name is Zhengru Fang (ÊñπÊîøÂÑí). I am a PhD student from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/), City University of Hong Kong (CityU), under the supervision of [Prof. Yuguang "Michael" Fang](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~yugufang/). I received my M.S. degree from [Tsinghua University](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/) (2019-2022) and B.S. degree from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/) (2015-2019).

My research interests focus on collaborative perception, V2X communications, age of information, and mobile edge computing. I have published several papers at top journals (e.g., IEEE/ACM ToN, IEEE JSAC, IEEE TMC) and conferences (e.g., ACM MM, IEEE ICRA) [![Google Scholar Stats](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fangzr/google-scholar-stats/main/gs_stats.json&logo=google-scholar&logoColor=white)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yggQMJMAAAAJ).

**Contact:** I'm always open to academic discussions and collaborations! Feel free to email me at zhefang4-c[AT]my[DOT]cityu[DOT]edu[DOT]hk
